            "- 6 large eggs\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Prepare Potatoes and Onion**:\n",
            "   - Peel the potatoes and slice them thinly (about 1/8 inch thick).\n",
            "   - If you're using onion, chop it finely.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Cook Potatoes and Onion**:\n",
            "   - Heat a generous amount of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. You want enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan.\n",
            "   - Once the oil is hot, add the sliced potatoes and cook them gently. Stir occasionally, and cook for about 20 minutes until they are soft but not browned.\n",
            "   - If using onion, add it to the potatoes about halfway through cooking, and stir until the onion is translucent.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Beat the Eggs**:\n",
            "   - While the potatoes are cooking, crack the eggs into a large bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper, then whisk until well combined.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Combine Potatoes with Eggs**:\n",
            "   - Once the potatoes (and onion, if used) are cooked, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the bowl with beaten eggs. Mix gently to combine, making sure the potatoes are coated with the egg.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Cook the Omelette**:\n",
            "   - Remove most of the oil from the frying pan, leaving just enough to coat the bottom. Heat the pan over medium heat.\n",
            "   - Pour the potato and egg mixture into the pan, spreading it evenly. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the bottom is set and lightly browned.\n",
            "   - To flip the omelette, place a large plate over the pan and carefully invert the omelette onto the plate. Slide it back into the pan to cook the other side for another 5-7 minutes.\n",
            "\n",
